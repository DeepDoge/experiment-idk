# What is this?

This is some experimental idea to build web apps. It's inspired by HTMX, SvelteKit Form Actions and use:enhance.

- Gets idea of HTML as app state from HTMX.
- Also, uses the idea of form actions from SvelteKit to have a site both works with JS and without JS.

It's just an experiment, not a project or anything. I'm just trying to see if it's possible to build a web app with this idea. Proof of concept or something.

If works might make a proper project out of it.

This doesn't replace [cherry-ts](https://github.com/DeepDoge/cherry-ts). If it works, it will be a different thing. And both can be used together.

## Duck Typing

- Alright so I started to see the idea of "Snippets" here. They are reactive parts of the page with a source. How they work atm is pretty much faulty. Just trying to figure out what is a "Snippet" and how it should work. It can be the only thing that is needed to make this work. I'm not sure yet.
